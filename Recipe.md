1. Before we begin making sambar, it always helps to soak tamarind in water earlier. So soak 1 tablespoon tamarind in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.

2. Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.

7. When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely cooked and mushy. mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk. Cover and keep aside. You can see the consistency of dal in the picture below.

Cooking vegetables

8. When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables. When making sambar, chop the vegetables which get cooked faster in large sizes like pumpkin, brinjals (small aubergines) okra, drumsticks etc.

Vegetables which take more time to cook are to be chopped in small sizes like carrots, potatoes, etc. I have chopped the pumpkin in large cubes and the carrots and potatoes in small cubes.

Chop the brinjals before you add them in the pan or else they darken. You will need 1 to 1.5 cup of chopped vegetables.

9. Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).

10. Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste. Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. I add it for a nice bright color in the sambar.

20. Simmer on a medium-low flame till it comes to a boil. Stir at intervals. You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling.

At this step switch off the heat. Cover and keep aside. Check the taste and add salt if required.

Tempering

21. In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil (oil made from raw sesame seeds).

You can even use sunflower oil, ghee or coconut oil instead. Add ½ tsp mustard seeds.

28. Serve sambar hot. Garnish with some coriander leaves if you prefer. Usually, it is is cooked a two-three hours earlier as its taste becomes better with time.

However, we prefer sambar to be served as soon as it is made. It can also be served with steamed rice, idli, dosa, medu vada or uttapam.
